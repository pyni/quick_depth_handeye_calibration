# quick_depth_handeye_calibration
Usually, we solve calibration problem by AX=XB.Acutally, this is too trouble. This repository introduces a simple method for handeye calibration with a quite high precision.


you can run:
calibrationinteractive.launch

And move point cloud on the model,like this:

Although it is simple, the final test precision is higher than traditional calibration methods:
